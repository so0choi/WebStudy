  <h2> What did I Do Today</h2>
  <p>
    Today I woke up so late. I think it's because I fell asleep too late
    last night. I don't know why! because last night when I was on the bus
    to see Yuta's leaving, I was sooo tired and sleepy. Anyway I woke up
    almost 1:30pm today. It's really bad I think.. I didn't make this time
    as a vacation for just sleeping. At first I cooked an instant noodle which
    I bought yesterday with Sora. She said it's the best top 1 ramen in the
    world. Also it was on sale so I should buy it. It was better than I thought
    Now, I am hungry so I wanna cook it.. maybe I can make it after finish this.
