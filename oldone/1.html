    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </a>
  </P>

  <p>  I think I already studied this for at least 5 times, but I always forget about this. I don't know what is the main problem.
  Maybe, it's because I just watch lectures and follow some examples then do not review what I did before.</p>
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">

  <p style="margin-top:45px;"/*css*/>  Also I kept giving up studying html. I am sure this was the most important problem.
  If I didn't give up and keep studying it, I could review contents what I did before that day, and also study forward.
  So from now on I hope I do not give up anymore and dominate all html, or please at least do not forget basic grammar of HTML!!</p>
